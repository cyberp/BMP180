# BMP180 Library

Library for using the [BMP180](https://oberguru.net/elektronik/bmp180/bmp180.html) temperature sensor in Arduino projects.

Written by Joachim Schwender.

Two versions: one implementation of integer aritmetic, another in floating point.
If your device can handle floating point, this version is preferred, as the 
rounding noise is much better.
